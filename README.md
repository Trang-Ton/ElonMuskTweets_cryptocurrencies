### 1. Data 
Closing prices of cryptocurrencies obtained from 01/01/2020 - 21/08/2021:
* ![](assets/Bitcoin.png) Bitcoin (BTC)
* ![](assets/Dogecoin.png) Dogecoin (DOGE)
* ![](assets/ETHcoin.png) Ethereum (ETH)
* ![](assets/Cardano.png) Cardano (ADA)
* ![](assets/Litecoin.png) Litecoin (LTC)

* ![](assets/CCMIX.png) the crescent cryptocurrency market index (CCMIX) index. 

* 1600 tweets from Elon Musk's![](assets/Twitter1.png) Twitter account are collected, with specific filtering for crypto-related tweets including terms like "bitcoin", "dogecoin", and "cryptocurrency" 

### 2. Event study
The study carries out an event study in both short-term and long-term analyses with the help of the cumulative abnormal return approach (CAR) and the buy-and-hold abnormal return approach (BHAR). Both approaches are constructed based on the market model.

The event window is divided into sub-sections, including the event date, leakage information window, and price delay window.

a. Short-term analysis - CAR approach
* The short-term event window: T1 = -10 (days), T2 = 10 (days).

b. Long-term analysis - BHAR approach
* The long-term event window was 3 months after the announcement date of the event.

### 3. Main results ðŸ’¡

âœ… The findings revealed a smaller and less clear influence than initially assumed. 

âœ… No significant impact was observed in the post-event window due to the fast-paced nature of cryptocurrencies and frequent tweets by Musk. 

âœ… However, two significant tweets (Event 2 & 4 in Table 1) were identified that appeared to influence cryptocurrencies in the short term.

The abnormal returns of event two, for example, a deflection of these can also clearly be seen at time zero (see figure above). The same results can be seen for the fourth and fifth events as well.
